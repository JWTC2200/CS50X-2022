            <hr>
            <p> Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. Released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh, it is the second game in the Age of Empires series. The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations.</p>
            <p>Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which conscript the player to specialized and story-backed conditions, as well as three additional single-player game modes; multiplayer is also supported.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The specific version of the game I play is known as the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aoeiide/" class="link_red">Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
            <p>I tend to enjoy playing what are known as 'archer civs' which have a preferance for using archers and their upgrade units as the main combat unit.</p>
            <p>The most iconic archer civ in AoE 2 would be the Britons as a foot archer civilization</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <br>
            <img src="/Images/aoe2_britons_logo.jpg" class="briton_icon">
            <p>The Britons are an archer civilization with a simple-yet-effective unique unit, the Longbowman, and bonuses aiding their offensive and defensive capabilities. These make them an easy-to-use, borderline jack-of-all-trades civilization</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Civilization bonuses</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Town Centers cost -50% wood once the Castle Age is reached.</li>
              <li>Foot archers (except Skirmishers) have +1/+2 range in the Castle/Imperial Age.</li>
              <li>Shepherds work 25% faster.</li>
              <li>Team Bonus: Archery Ranges work 20% faster.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Unique units</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><img src="/Images/aoe2_longbowman.jpg" alt="Longbowman" class="tiny_icon"> Longbowman (long-ranged archer)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Unique technologies</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><img src="/Images/aoe2_unique_silver.jpg" alt="Yeomen" class="tiny_icon"> Yeoman (+1 range for foot archers and +2 attack for towers)</li>
              <li><img src="/Images/aoe2_unique_gold.jpg" alt="Warwolf" class="tiny_icon"> Warwolf (Trebuchets do blast damage and habe 100% accuracy against units) </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>Their archers gain bonus range in the Castle and Imperial Age and are trained faster. In addition their unique technology increases their range even more and grants towers additional attack. In total their foot archers gain +3 range, giving them an advantage against the archers of other civilizations. Their unique unit, the Longbowman, has the longest range of any archer. Due to their range Longbowmen can cut down opposing forces before they can even get close. Even enemy archers will likely be killed before they get in range. If in a large enough group they are almost impossible to counter. Cavalry are the main threat of Longbowmen, but the Britons have full infantry technology so can build Halberdiers to provide close combat protection from cavalry for the Longbowmen. If played in conjunction with the Saracens, their team bonus will allow Longbowmen to deal additional damage to buildings. Britons have almost full University technologies. </p>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>However the Britons have several weaknesses. They have poor cavalry, lacking both the Hussar and Paladin upgrades, cannot build Camel Riders, and lack Bloodlines. Their siege weapons are similarly lacking, missing the Siege Ram, Siege Onager, and Bombard Cannon, and being unable to research Redemption would mean that they cannot convert any enemy siege units for themselves, therefore being greatly disadvantaged when facing enemies with Bombard Cannons. They are missing the Parthian Tactics and Thumb Ring upgrades, though their inherent archer bonuses compensates for this (and Thumb Ring would make Longbowmen overpowered). </p>
            <p>In addition, they also lack Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons, thus further limiting their archer and siege options. Although historically the British were known for their heavy use of gunpowder as means of expanding their empire in the New World, those events occurred long after the medieval period, i.e. in the time of Age of Empires III. And one could also say the lack of said units is for balance purposes. </p>
